//! SC-W5-041 – Canonical event schema for SLA calculation outputs.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical schema for all contract events consumed
//! by backend indexers. Every event follows the same structural contract:
//!
//! Topic layout (3 topics):
//!   topic[0] = event name (Symbol constant)
//!   topic[1] = event version ("v1")
//!   topic[2] = event-specific context (severity, caller address, etc.)
//!
//! Payload field ordering and types are documented below per event variant.
//! These schemas MUST NOT be changed without a corresponding version bump.
//!
//! # Event Catalog
//!
//! The three decision-carrying events (`sla_calc`, `set_int`, `dup_input`)
//! share a single canonical payload field order — the `SLAResult` struct
//! order — so indexers parse one layout regardless of which decision event
//! they consume. Any divergence between them is a bug (#429). The canonical
//! order is:
//!
//!   (outage_id, status, mttr_minutes, threshold_minutes, amount,
//!    payment_type, rating, config_version_hash, recorded_at)
//!
//! `sla_calc` and `dup_input` carry exactly those nine fields. `set_int`
//! carries the same nine fields in the same order **plus** a trailing
//! `correlation_id` field (see below) — an additive extension that does not
//! disturb the shared prefix (#566).
//!
//! ## sla_calc (`sla_calc`)
//! Emitted on every successful `calculate_sla` call.
//! - topic[2]: severity Symbol
//! - payload:  (outage_id: Symbol, status: Symbol, mttr_minutes: u32,
//!   threshold_minutes: u32, amount: i128, payment_type: Symbol,
//!   rating: Symbol, config_version_hash: u64, recorded_at: u64)
//!
//! ## set_int (`set_int`)
//! Settlement intent emitted alongside sla_calc for backend reconciliation.
//! Carries the full decision (including `mttr_minutes`, `threshold_minutes`,
//! and `rating`) so a settlement-only consumer can reconstruct the SLA
//! decision without a follow-up read (#428).
//! - topic[2]: severity Symbol
//! - payload:  (outage_id: Symbol, status: Symbol, mttr_minutes: u32,
//!   threshold_minutes: u32, amount: i128, payment_type: Symbol,
//!   rating: Symbol, config_version_hash: u64, recorded_at: u64,
//!   correlation_id: u64)
//!
//! The trailing `correlation_id` field (an additive change, #566) is the
//! **single documented home** of the correlation ID (SC-W5-079): it is
//! `event_correlation::generate_correlation_id`'s output for the (outage_id,
//! ledger sequence) pair of the emitting calculation, so a backend can join
//! the `set_int` to its originating calculation deterministically. It is the
//! only decision event that carries the id — `sla_calc` and `dup_input` stay
//! at nine fields. (`#565`)
//!
//! ## dup_input (`dup_input`)
//! Emitted when `calculate_sla` rejects a conflicting duplicate `outage_id`
//! (the `DuplicateOutageInput` error path). Carries the previously stored
//! `SLAResult` so consumers can reconcile the rejection without a separate
//! `get_latest_by_outage` read. (#385)
//! - topic[2]: severity Symbol
//! - payload:  (outage_id: Symbol, status: Symbol, mttr_minutes: u32,
//!   threshold_minutes: u32, amount: i128, payment_type: Symbol,
//!   rating: Symbol, config_version_hash: u64, recorded_at: u64)
//!
//! ## cfg_upd (`cfg_upd`)
//! Emitted on every successful `set_config` call.
//! - topic[2]: severity Symbol
//! - payload:  (threshold_minutes: u32, penalty_per_minute: i128,
//!   reward_base: i128)
//! - repeated writes preserve invocation order; see the regression policy in
//!   `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
//!
//! ## sev_add (`sev_add`)
//! Emitted when `set_custom_severity` registers a **new** custom severity.
//! - topic[2]: custom severity Symbol
//! - payload:  (threshold_minutes: u32, penalty_per_minute: i128,
//!   reward_base: i128)
//!
//! ## sev_upd (`sev_upd`)
//! Emitted when `set_custom_severity` **reconfigures** an existing one.
//! - topic[2]: custom severity Symbol
//! - payload:  (threshold_minutes: u32, penalty_per_minute: i128,
//!   reward_base: i128)
//!
//! ## cfg_rem (`cfg_rem`)
//! Emitted when `remove_custom_severity` deletes a custom severity.
//! - topic[2]: custom severity Symbol
//! - payload:  ()
//!
//! ## paused (`paused`)
//! Emitted when the contract is paused.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  (true,)
//!
//! ## unpause (`unpause`)
//! Emitted when the contract is unpaused.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  (false,)
//!
//! ## op_set (`op_set`)
//! Emitted when the operator is set directly by the admin (single-step legacy path).
//! Unlike the two-step path (`op_prop` → `op_acc`), this event indicates the new
//! operator did **not** consent to the role change — `set_operator` only requires
//! the admin's authorization. Consumers that need to distinguish consented from
//! non-consented operator changes should check for this event name vs. the
//! `op_prop`+`op_acc` pair.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address (admin who performed the set)
//! - payload:  (new_operator: Address,)
//!
//! ## pruned (`pruned`)
//! Emitted after a prune_history call removes entries.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  (removed_count: u32, kept_count: u32)
//!
//! ## pruned_a (`pruned_a`)
//! Emitted after a prune_history_by_age call removes entries.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  (removed_count: u32, kept_count: u32)
//!
//! ## adm_prop (`adm_prop`)
//! Emitted when a new admin is proposed.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  (new_admin: Address,)
//!
//! ## adm_acc (`adm_acc`)
//! Emitted when a pending admin proposal is accepted.

//! Emitted when the admin renounces their role.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  ()
//!
//! ## adm_sup (`adm_sup`)
//! Emitted when a pending admin proposal is superseded by a re-proposal
//! before the prior candidate accepted or cancelled. (#468)
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  (superseded_admin: Address, new_admin: Address)
//!
//! ## adm_xp (`adm_xp`)
//! Emitted at most once when a lapsed admin proposal is first observed by an
//! accept attempt, immediately before the pending admin keys are cleared. (#589)
//! - topic[2]: caller Address (the caller whose accept attempt observed expiry)
//! - payload:  (expired_admin: Address,)
//!

//! cleared. (#589)
//! - topic[2]: caller Address (the caller whose accept attempt observed expiry)
//! - payload:  (expired_operator: Address,)
//!
//! ## cfg_frz (`cfg_frz`)
//! Emitted when the configuration is frozen by admin.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  ()
//!
//! ## cfg_unfrz (`cfg_unfrz`)
//! Emitted when the configuration is unfrozen by admin.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  ()
//!
//! ## stats_sat (`stats_sat`)
//! Emitted when a running-stats counter saturates during increment_stats
//! (e.g. total_calculations reaching u64::MAX, or an i128 total capping).
//! Signals backend indexers that the on-chain total has capped and now
//! under-reports true economic exposure. The counter is still capped at its
//! bound on-chain; this event carries the pre-cap state so consumers can
//! reconcile. (SC-W5-047)
//! - topic[2]: counter_name Symbol (which counter saturated: `totcalc`,
//!   `totviol`, `totrew`, `totpen`)
//! - payload:  (field: Symbol, previous_value: i128, attempted_increment: i128)
//!
//! ## migrate_done (`migrate_done`)
//! Emitted when a storage migration completes successfully.
//! - topic[2]: caller Address
//! - payload:  (old_version: u32, new_version: u32)
//!
//! # Schema Versioning
//!
//! Breaking changes (field removal, type changes, reordering) MUST increment
//! the version symbol from "v1" to "v2". Additive changes (new fields at the
//! end) are NOT considered breaking and do not require a version bump as long
//! as old consumers ignore unrecognised trailing fields.
//!
//! The `set_int` payload gained the trailing `correlation_id` field under
//! `"v1"` as an additive change (#566); the `EVENT_ABI_GENERATION` co-bump
//! invariant (#497) applies only to breaking event changes and remains
//! unchanged.
//!
//! # Symbol Deprecation Protocol
//!
//! When a Result or Severity symbol needs to change, follow this deprecation
//! lifecycle to avoid breaking backend consumers:
//!
//! 1. **Introduction (minor release)**: Add the new symbol alongside the old one.
//!    Both symbols are emitted in events. `get_result_schema()` returns both
//!    with a `deprecated_symbols` entry marking the old symbol as deprecated.
//!
//! 2. **Coexistence (at least one minor release)**: The old symbol continues to
//!    be emitted alongside the new one. Backends can migrate at their own pace.
//!    The `deprecated_symbols` entry includes `removed_at` = None (TBD).
//!
//! 3. **Removal (major release)**: The old symbol is removed from event emission.
//!    The `schema_version` in `get_result_schema()` is bumped. The deprecated
//!    entry remains in `deprecated_symbols` with `removed_at` set to the schema
//!    version at which removal occurred.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! If we replace `"viol"` with `"violated"` as the human-readable status:
//!
//! - **v1**: `"viol"` is the only status symbol for violated SLAs.
//! - **v2**: `"violated"` is introduced. Events emit both `"viol"` and
//!   `"violated"`. `get_result_schema()` returns:
//!   ```json
//!   {
//!     "status_met": "met",
//!     "status_violated": "violated",
//!     "deprecated_symbols": [
//!       { "old_symbol": "viol", "new_symbol": "violated", "deprecated_at": 2, "removed_at": null }
//!     ]
//!   }
//!   ```
//! - **v3**: `"viol"` is removed. Events emit only `"violated"`.
//!   `deprecated_symbols` is updated with `removed_at: 3`.
//!
//! Backends MUST check `deprecated_symbols` at startup and log warnings for
//! any deprecated symbols they still rely on.
//!
//! # Review Checklist
//!
//! When adding or modifying events, refer to both the SC-099 Event-Topic Schema
//! Checklist and the SC-100 Public Method Review Checklist in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
